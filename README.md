# Summary of Marine Stratus and Fog

 My understanding of the Powerpoint slides presented by Prof. Peter Taylor for the Fog Dew meeting



## Lessons Learned
### Slide 2

There is a comparison made between marine and land fog:

**Land Fog**
* On land, it is mostly radiation fog and there is nocturnal cooling of the land surfaces.
* Stable stratification and light winds and may have drainage flow of cold air to lower locations.
* Uphill winds leading to adiabatic cooling.
* Onshore advection of marine fog in coastal areas.

**Marine Fog**
* Surface radiation effects are small due to the large heat capacity of water and there is low diurnal temperature variations.
* Moderate to strong winds affect fog and stratus lowering may occur.
* Warm, moist air moving to the colder sea surface of the ocean lead to advection fog.
* Tidal mixing of the sea affect fog formation and stability. Eg: Yellow Sea.

### Slide 3-5
**The setup used:**

Above the water surface, there is a steady, well-mixed boundary layer so potential temperature(&theta;) and water vapour mixing ratio (q) should with time become equal to the surface values.

The atmospheric boundary layer over the ocean is capped by stable stratification at around 1-2 km and the winds can be strong.

A radiative cooling was introduced and saturation mixing ratio and saturation vapour pressure decrease with height leading to some condensation.
